# EthereumSea
Explore the Ethereum Sea

*This game is released freely and will always remain free to play because the grace of God is available freely through His son Jesus Christ.*

EthereumSea is a sandbox for roleplaying.  The app uses the ethereum blockchain to generate a sea of random islands to explore.  Nations, people and factions are also generated.  Every so often the islands will shift based upon a random current - to make things interesting.   

You can save the app's state to return to it later.  However, when you do the islands will also shift.  

The DEV app is playable:
