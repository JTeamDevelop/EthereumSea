# EthereumSea
Explore the Ethereum Sea

*This game is released freely and will always remain free to play because the grace of God is available freely through His son Jesus Christ.*

![Example of the Sea](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JTeamDevelop/EthereumSea/master/ESExample.png)

EthereumSea is a sandbox.  The app uses the ethereum blockchain to generate a "sea" of random planes to explore.  Nations, people and factions are also generated.  As the blockchain changes, so will the Sea.  Planes are defined by Ethereum addresses, and as the balance grows and shrinks, so does the plane's size.  While links to other planes are created and destroyed with every transaction.   

This is currently in development, but you can view the state.
